# Coding Challenge 
## DESCRIPTION

I started this task from scratch using the React framework.
I used the **hook useReducer** because I wanted to practice it.
The hook helps us manage a state. It is very similar to useState hook, but it lets you move the state update logic from event handler into a single function outside of component.
We can manage our state mutations in one place.


#### What have be done

- Created a todo list app where the user can create/edit/delete tasks,
- The user is able to toggle tasks using checkbox with extra word "done" if task is Done =),
- When a task is deleted, it is removed from the list,
- When we Add New tasks, the task is added to the top of the list,
- Testing functionality by using Jest
